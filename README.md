This repository contains the implementation of MRD and LRPC codes including some of their polynomial time decoding algorithms.
Three different families are included for MRD codes: Gabidulin codes, TZ codes and non-additive partition codes. Gabidulin codes have two different decoding approaches,
leading to two separate classes.

Additionally, there are different TESTING files for each of the codes. The parameters can be changed to test each implementation.
